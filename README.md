### I suffer from impostor syndrome
I believe in my case it is not that I am adequate and doubt myself, but that my impostor syndrome is telling me that I need to improve myself. This repo is public proof of me trying to do just that.

### There will be no use of AI in this repo
* I will not use AI for tips, auto complete, or generative code.
* Unless the project I'm working on is to impliment some kind of AI or interface with AI.
* The code itself will be stricly man vs machine.
* I am not Anti AI, I use AI extensively in my day to day, I seek to improve in my programming ability however, and I believe AI hampers this endeavor.
