package stepByStepSum

//Given an array of integers nums, you start with an initial positive value startValue.
//In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus elements in nums (from left to right).
//Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

//Input: nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: If you choose startValue = 4, in the third iteration your step by step sum is less than 1.
